I'm using this form to gauge interest and determine "Lunch-&-Learn" content -- let me know what you want us to cover! 
<br><br>
I've drafted a [tentative schedule](./schedule.md) with material I'm comfortable teaching, but I'm open to making adjustments based on whatever the group decides.

## Philosophy 🧠💻

* **Open & inclusive.** All experience levels welcome! Questions encouraged, peer-support expected. Come ready to collaborate!
* **Hands‑on.** Most of the time is reserved for "hacking" -- project-based learning in a supportive atmosphere. Will assign objectives for group learning, but folks with prior experience are welcome to work on their own projects.
* **Reproducible.** Will use open data (OpenNeuro) and open tools (BIDS, fMRIPrep, Nilearn) to meet learning objectives. Code and other materials/resources shared via public GitHub repos.
* **Fun.** Lunch is social, hacking is collaborative, and all progress is celebrated ☺️
