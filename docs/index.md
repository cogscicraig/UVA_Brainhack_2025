## Philosophy 🧠💻

Format and tone inspired by the [Brainhack](https://brainhack.org/about.html) ethos -- open, inclusive, and collaborative -- emphasizing learning-by-doing, peer support, and a relaxed atmosphere 😎

* **Open & inclusive.** All experience levels welcome! Questions encouraged, peer-support expected. Come ready to collaborate! <br>
* **Hands‑on.** Most of the time is reserved for "hacking" -- project-based learning in a supportive atmosphere. Will assign objectives for group learning, but folks with prior experience are welcome to work on their own projects. <br>
* **Reproducible.** Will use open data (OpenNeuro) and open tools (BIDS, fMRIPrep, Nilearn) to meet learning objectives. Code and other materials/resources shared via public GitHub repos. <br>
* **Fun.** Lunch is social, hacking is collaborative, and all progress is celebrated ☺️
