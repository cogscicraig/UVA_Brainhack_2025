\* Lunch meetings will consist of informal lectures/discussion (\~1-2hrs) followed by "hacking" -- time set aside for hands-on learning with code-curious comrades. ***Lunch will be provided*(!)** to folks who sign up, courtesy of the Morris/Connelly Labs 

<br> 🥪 Come for the food, stay for the code! 🤖 <br>

## Philosophy 🧠💻

> *“We can do without an extended family as human beings about as easily as we can do without vitamins or essential minerals.” -[Kurt Vonnegut](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/5165342)*

<br>

Format and tone inspired by the [Brainhack](https://brainhack.org/about.html) ethos -- open, inclusive, and collaborative -- emphasizing learning-by-doing, peer support, and a relaxed atmosphere 😎☀️ Perfect for summertime, y'all!

<br>

* **Open & inclusive.** All experience levels welcome! Questions encouraged, peer-support expected. Come ready to collaborate! <br><br>
* **Hands‑on.** Most of the time is reserved for "hacking" -- project-based learning in a supportive atmosphere. I will design objectives for group learning once we've finalized the schedule, but folks with prior experience are always welcome to work on their own projects. <br><br>
* **Reproducible.** Will use open data (OpenNeuro) and open tools (BIDS, fMRIPrep, Nilearn) to meet learning objectives. Code and other materials/resources shared via public GitHub repos licensed under [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). <br><br>
* **Fun.** Lunch is social, hacking is collaborative, and all progress is celebrated ☺️ <br><br>

(That all sound great, Craig, but I still don't understand... **[Why are you doing this??](./why.md)**)

If there's a topic you want to learn, let it be known; if there's a topic you want to teach, even better! I've prepared a tentative schedule based on initial responses (see below), but it's super flexible.

I'm using this form to gauge interest/experience and determine "Lunch-&-Learn" content -- let me know what you want us to cover!!

## (Tentative) Schedule 📅

Here's a roungh draft of the [Weekly Schedule](./schedule.md). I've included a very basic list of topics we *could* cover, but I'm happy to make adjustments -- it depends on who wants to participate and what people say on the interest form.
