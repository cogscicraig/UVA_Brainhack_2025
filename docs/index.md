# Summer Neuroimaging & Coding Workshop Series

*A collaborative, Brainhack‑inspired learning space for psychology & neuroscience students*

**When:** Fridays, 12pm – 5pm (lunch provided!)  |  **Where:** Gilmer 300  |  **Dates:** May 30 – late August (extendable into Fall)

## Workshop Philosophy 🧠💻

* **Open & inclusive.** All experience levels welcome. Questions encouraged, peer-support expected.
* **Hands‑on.** Short mini‑lectures (\~1 h) followed by "hacking" time (\~3–4 h).
* **Reproducible.** We use open data (OpenNeuro) and open tools (BIDS, fMRIPrep, Nilearn).
* **Fun.** Lunch is social, hacking is collaborative, and progress is celebrated.

## Quick Start  🚀

1. **Install the toolkit** *(before Week 1)*. I recommend [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) plus the `environment.yml` in this repo so you have all the necessay packages.
2. **Create a GitHub account** if you don’t have one.
3. **Clone this repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cogscicraig/UVA_Brainhack_2025.git
   ```
