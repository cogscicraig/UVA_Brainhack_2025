# Why ‚ÅâÔ∏è

I'll tell you why! <br>

<p>Before my time, so I'm told, Morris Lab members used to hold regular meetings to write/edit code and talk about neuroimaging. Oh! Those were the days! (I imagine)</p>
<p>Well, we're a dry lab that does a lot of human neuroimaging work, so this makes sense. But in the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic this practice waned. Senior lab members graduated, and it died off completely... </p>
<p>But now I aim to bring it back, bigger and better than ever! Like a pheonix, rising from the ashes -- Kaww! Screech! Kaww! üê•üî• </p>

<p>
  So, yeah, here we are. I want to create a space for students (not just Morris lab members, since I'm about to be the only one) to come together to write code and geek out about neuroimaging. And I want to give new students, in particular, a fun environment to learn the basics and best practices of coding for brain research.
  I feel comfortable teaching about MRI, cuz it's my jam, but I'd love to cover other imaging modalities as well. I'll lead as much as I can, but I'm hoping others will chip in to make this a more valuable learning opportunity for everyone (hint hint <sub>please help me</sub>). 
  While I'm not an expert programmer, I do have some experinece coding in Python, R, MatLab, Java, C/C++, Bash, JavaScript/HTML, and even a little x86 Assembly (yikes). I like programming ü§ì it's fun! But it isn't always fun, especially if you're new to it and don't have access to the right resources. 
  So let's help each other out!
</p>
<p>
  When you write code, you make mistakes. I've made plenty, and I want others to learn from them. Likewise, I want to leverage the wisdom of my peers! So I really hope y'all will join me in creating a fun and collaborative learning atmosphere for summer 2025.

Plus, hey, ***there's free lunch!***
